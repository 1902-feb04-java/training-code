# Java
Java is an object-oriented programming language and a platform developed by Sun Microsystems (eaten by Oracle). Using the principle of **WORA** (Write Once, Run Anywhere), a Java application can be compiled and executed on any platform supported by Java. Flexible, popular, and well-supported, Java has helps developers write scalable client-server web applications, desktop and mobile applications, and frameworks and libraries.

## Features
- **Platform independence**: The compiler converts source code to bytecode, then the JVM executes that bytecode. While each operating system has their own JVM implementation, so every JVM can execute bytecode regardless of origin of said code.

- **Clear, verbose syntax** Java has C-like syntax like C++ and C#, many syntax elements of the language are readable and widely used in programming. The Java API (Application Programming Interface) is also written using verbose, descriptive naming conventions making it simple to parse large code bases.

- **Multi-paradigm** While Java is object-oriented, it supports multiple paradigms such as imperative, generic, concurrent, and functional.

- **Garbage collection** The JVM performs automatic memory deallocation of unused objects at runtime. Programs are written without the need for complex memory management.

- **Multithreading** Java supports multithreading at both language and the standard library levels. It allows concurrent and parallel execution of several parts of a Java program.

- **Object-Oriented Programming** Although Java accommodates several paradigms, OOP is the foundation for most applications. In OOP, a program is organized into objects encapsulating related fields (representing its *state*) and methods (usually to control that state or perform related functions). When defining objects, Java reserves the keyword *class* (not to be confused with the *.class* file extension) which serves as their blueprint. An object in Java represents an instance in memory of a class, and also every class implicitly inherits from the *Object* superclass which provides useful convenience methods such as *equals()* and *toString()*. Java popularized several 'Pillars' of OOP design theory. While the numbers vary between OOP languages, Java focuses on four:

    - *Abstraction* - By simplifying objects to a set of useful features, we hide irrelevant details, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency. Abstraction is important at all levels of software and computer engineering, but essential to designing useful objects. Complicated real-world objects are reduced to simple representations.

    - *Encapsulation* - Objects should group together related variables and functions and be in complete control over them. So the state of an object should only change, if ever, through the object itself. Also known as data hiding, because the object has sole responsibility for its fields, and no outside object or function should interfere.

    - *Inheritance* - Code reuse is an important principle of programming (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself), and new classes can reuse code from existing ones. This establishes a superclass-subclass (or parent-child) relationship where the derived classes inherit (and sometimes change) fields and methods from its parent.

    - *Polymorphism* - With inheritance, an object of a derived class can be referenced as instances of its parent class. This provides flexibility when invoking inherited methods with varying implementations in derived classes.

## Variables
A value is stored and identified in memory by a variable. Variables have a name that makes it possible to access the value, and a type that defines what sort of value it stores.
```java
int variableName = 64;
String txtVar = "Hello World";
```

## Primitive data types
Java handles two kinds of datatypes: primitives and references. Primitives are variables that store simple values. There are eight in Java.
- Integer types: **byte**, **short**, **int**, and **long** (42)  
- Floating-point types: **float**, and **double** (3.1415)  
- Logical types: **boolean** (true)  
- Character type: **char** ('x')

## Reference types
Reference types store the memory address location of more complex data types in the heap. Reference types include:
- Classes
- Interfaces
- Enums
- Arrays

## Naming variables
- Case sensitivity
- Can only use letters, numbers, and *$* or *_* characters
- Cannot begin with a number
- Cannot be a reserved Java keyword

## Scopes of a variable
A variable's reference will only exist within the context of its declared scope, which is based on the location of its declaration.

- **Static** or class scoped variables are visible to all instances of a related class.
- **Instance** or object scoped variables are visible to only that object instance.
- **Local** or method scoped variables are visible only within a method.
- **Block** or loop scoped variables are visible only within a block statement.

Be aware of *shadowing*: when two variables in different scopes share names.

## Methods
Methods accept a list of arguments known as *parameters* and return some value. They are used to implement repeatable, consistent actions on variable input, much like math functions.
```java
public int myMethod(int a, int b);
public int myMethod(int a);
```

## Constructors
Classes not only define object fields and methods, but how it should be instantiated through special methods called constructors. Constructors must have no return type and share the same name as its class. Java will automatically give you a *noargs* constructor. However, if you define any constructor, you will lose the automatically given constructor.

While a constructor may be *private*, used for singletons, it may not be *final*, *static*, or *abstract*.

## Access modifiers
- **private** - accessible only within the context of that class
- **default** - accessible within the context of a package, has no associated keyword so is set when no modifier is used
- **protected** - accessible to the package, but also to derived child classes outside of the package
- **public** - accessible anywhere

Classes should only be public or default. There are no cascading access levels, and unspecified fields will be default. Subclasses can only change inherited fields to be less restrictive.

# Arrays
## Declaration
Java Arrays are special reference types that store similarly typed data iteratively. A pair of brackets define an array of some data type, and can be written anywhere after the type:
```java
// One-Dimensional Arrays
int[] arrayOne;
int []arrayTwo;
int arrayThree[];

// Two-Dimensional Arrays
int[][] 2DArrayOne;
int 2DArrayTwo[][];
int []2DArrayThree[];
```

## Definition
While Java does not allow direct memory access to its arrays like other languages, they are still of fixed size once defined by the `new` keyword or by an array literal.
```java
// One-Dimensional Arrays
int[] instancedArray = new int[3];
int[] literalArray = {1, 2, 3};

// Two-Dimensional Arrays
int[][] instanced2DArray = new int[3][4];
int[][] literal2DArray = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 }, { 5, 6 } };
```

## Iteration
Java for loops can iterate through arrays like most other languages:
```java
// One-Dimensional Arrays
for (int i = 0; i < arrayOne.length; i++) {
    System.out.print(arrayOne[i]);
}

// Two-Dimensional Arrays
for (int i = 0; i < 2DArrayOne.length; i++) {
    for (int j  =0; j < 2DArrayOne[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(2DArrayOne[i][j]);
    }
}

// Foreach loops
for (int i : arrayOne) {
    System.out.print(i);
}
```

## Manipulation
The `java.util.Arrays` class provides various methods for manipulating arrays.

```java
int[] messyArray = {234, 5346, 3, 64};
Arrays.sort(messyArray);
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(messyArray));
```

## Varargs
Varargs is a special parameter that can accept multiple arguments of the same type into a dynamically constructed array, and denoted by an ellipsis (...) instead of brackets. A varargs parameter must be the last or only parameter in a method signature. 
```java
varArgMethod("m", 1, 2, 5, 35, 346, 345, 4634);

...

public static void varArgDemo(String m, int... intArgs) {
    for (int i : intArgs) {
        System.out.print(i);
    }
}
```
# Programming and Compiling
Most Java applications only require the **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment). But to write and compile you need the **JDK** (Java Development Kit). While the JRE provides Java's standard libraries and exceptions as well as a JVM, the JDK provides all the above as well as *javac*, the compiler. Java source code is written in text files labeled with *.java* extension. It is then compiled into bytecode in *.class* files by *javac*. Then the bytecode is executed by the JVM, which translates the Java commands into low-level instructions to the operating system.

Since Java 6, all Java programs not run inside a container (such as a Servlet Web Container) start and end with the main method. The class containing the main method can have any name, but the method itself should always be named *main*

```java
class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Num args:" + args.length);
    }
}
```

- *public* is a Java access modifier keyword that means the `main` method can be accessed from any method during the program's execution.
- *static* is a Java keyword that means the method can be invoked without creating an instance of the class that contains it, making it a global method.
- *void* is a Java return type keyword that means the method doesn't return any values of any data type.
- *args* is a Java variable of type String array which means the method can take command line arguments as an array of Strings

We can compile this code into a *.class* file of the same name:
>javac Example.java

And to run the resulting `Example.class` file:
>java Example

The `java` and `javac` commands require the full directory path or class path to any source code or binary file respectively. If you have a package `com.demo` in the first line of Example, then you would nest the java file into a `com/demo/` directory and then run:
>javac com/demo/Example.java 

>java com.demo.Example

From here we can add packages and imports, expanding the application into a set of interacting objects. By default, the *javac* compiler implicitly imports several base packages from the standard library.

# Maven 
Build automation and dependency management tool. Once installed, use with the `mvn` command. Allows for a project to be IDE agnostic. See the official Maven project for documentation: http://maven.apache.org/index.html as well as the mvn repository to find available libraries: https://mvnrepository.com/

The minimum `pom.xml` example:
```xml
<project>
	<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
	<groupId>YourDomainName</groupId>
	<artifactId>YourProjectName</artifactId>
	<version>0.1.0</version>
</project>
```

## Example commands
Create a new Maven project with the quickstart archetype. Change groupId and artifactId arguments as needed:
>mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.revature -DartifactId=my-first-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
