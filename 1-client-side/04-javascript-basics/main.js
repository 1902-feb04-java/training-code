// JavaScript

// ECMAScript 5 (ES5)
// ES6 (ES2015)
// ES7 (ES2016)
// ES2017
// ES2018
// ES-Next

// JavaScript is not a compiled language, it's interpreted
// JavaScript runs in: (1) the browser, (2) server-side runtime like Node.JS

// JavaScript (ES5) is object-based (object-oriented language, without classes)
//   uses what's called "prototypal inheritance" to re-use behavior between objects
// from ES6 onwards, JavaScript actually does have classes

// JavaScript is dynamically-typed - variables do not have a type at all
