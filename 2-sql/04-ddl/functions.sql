-- functions
-- we can make re-usable functions in a variety of SQL-extension languages
-- we'll look at "SQL" functions and "PL/pgSQL" functions

-- a function that returns the current time.
CREATE FUNCTION get_current_time() RETURNS TIME WITH TIME ZONE
AS
$$
	SELECT CURRENT_TIME;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;
-- the function implicitly returns the last statement inside it.
-- we have VOID return type for when we don't need to return anything.

SELECT get_current_time();

-- we can give functions parameters and have them interact with tables
CREATE FUNCTION get_customer_initials(customer_id INTEGER) RETURNS VARCHAR(2)
AS
$$
	SELECT SUBSTRING(first_name, 1, 1) || SUBSTRING(last_name, 1, 1)
	FROM customers
	WHERE id = customer_id;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT get_customer_initials((
	SELECT id FROM customers
	WHERE first_name = 'Eduardo'
	LIMIT 1
));

SELECT * FROM employees;
CREATE FUNCTION all_employees_before_1970() RETURNS SETOF employees AS
$$
	SELECT * FROM employees
	WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM birth_date) < 1970
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;
SELECT all_employees_before_1970(); -- stuffs whole employee into one column
SELECT * FROM all_employees_before_1970(); -- expands employee back into his columns

CREATE FUNCTION employee_names() RETURNS TABLE(
	first_name VARCHAR(20),
	last_name VARCHAR(20)
) AS
$$
 	SELECT first_name, last_name
 	FROM employees;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;
SELECT * FROM employee_names();

-- the $$ $$ syntax is actually a multi-line string literal
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION name_of_alpha_last_employee(
	OUT first VARCHAR(20), OUT last VARCHAR(20)
) AS
$$
	SELECT first_name, last_name
	FROM employees

SELECT * FROM name_of_alpha_last_employee();

-- the parameters are also accessible with names $1, $2, $3 etc
-- so you don't need to give them names if you want to use those instead

-- exercises

-- 1. create a function that returns the length of a track

-- 2. create a function that returns the average total of all
--    invoices

-- 3. create a function that returns the most expensive track

-- 4. create a function that returns the average price of all invoice line
--    items

-- 5. create a function that updates some of the personal info of an
--    employee.

-- 6. create a function that, given an employee, returns all the employees he
--    manages (that report to him).

-- 7. create a function that, given an invoice id, will delete that
--    invoice, including all associated invoice line items.

-- PL/pgSQL functions support more procedural constructs like
-- if-conditional, loop, try catch

-- this function will be called whenever we want to suppress some row change

-- in a trigger function for BEFORE triggers, returning NULL
-- halts the operation before it occurs.

-- triggers
-- we have them on INSERT, on UPDATE, or on DELETE
-- also, BEFORE, AFTER, or INSTEAD OF (but INSTEAD OF only on views, not proper tables)
-- also, row-level trigger (FOR EACH ROW) or statement-level (FOR EACH STATEMENT)
