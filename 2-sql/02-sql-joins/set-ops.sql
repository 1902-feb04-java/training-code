-- set operations

-- in SQL we have some ways to combine two separate result sets.
-- operators UNION, UNION ALL,
--           INTERSECT, INTERSECT ALL,
--           EXCEPT, EXCEPT ALL

-- UNION involves concatenating two result sets into one.
--   (the number of columns and their types have to be the same)

-- all first names of customers and employees
SELECT employees.first_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT customers.first_name FROM customers;

-- for every set operator, there is an "ALL" version of it.
-- the default version (technically the "DISTINCT" version) removes all duplicates.
SELECT employees.first_name FROM employees
UNION ALL
SELECT customers.first_name FROM customers;
-- this one has some duplicate results.

-- the ALL versions are faster, because they don't need to spend time
-- removing duplicates.


-- all first names that are had by both a customer and an employee
SELECT employees.first_name FROM employees
INTERSECT
SELECT customers.first_name FROM customers;

-- all employee first names that no customer has
SELECT employees.first_name FROM employees
EXCEPT -- aka "set difference" (subtraction)
SELECT customers.first_name FROM customers;

-- subquery
-- this is another way to combine the data from multiple tables
-- any query you would write with joins, can usually be rewritten with subqueries
-- instead, and vice versa.

-- every track that has never been purchased
SELECT t.name
FROM tracks AS t
WHERE t.id NOT IN ( -- subquery
		SELECT il.track_id
		FROM invoice_lines AS il
	);

WITH purchased_tracks AS (
		SELECT il.track_id AS id
		FROM invoice_lines AS il
	)
SELECT t.name
FROM tracks AS t
WHERE t.id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM purchased_tracks);
-- the WITH clause lets us "declare" our subqueries before the main query
-- instead of in the middle of it.

-- for subqueries, we have operators:
--   EXISTS, NOT EXISTS
--   IN, NOT IN
--   SOME (aka ANY)
--   ALL

-- if the subquery returns exactly one value (one column, one row),
--   we can use any other operator or function with it: =, !=, <=, etc.

-- for example..
-- the artist who made the album with the longest title.
SELECT artists.name
FROM artists
WHERE artists.id = (
		SELECT a.artist_id
		FROM albums AS a
		WHERE LENGTH(a.title) >= ALL (SELECT LENGTH(albums.title) FROM albums)
	);
-- a better way to write that...
SELECT artists.name
FROM artists
WHERE artists.id = (
		SELECT a.artist_id
		FROM albums AS a
		ORDER BY LENGTH(a.title) DESC
		LIMIT 1
	);

-- we can use LIMIT <n> clause at the end of a SELECT statement
-- to limit the results returns

-- exercises

-- use subqueries for at least half of these exercises. use joins for
-- the others if you like, or better, write two answers, solving it either way.

-- 1. which artists did not make any albums at all?

-- 2. which artists did not record any tracks of the Latin genre?

-- 3. which video track has the longest length? (use media_type table)

-- 4. find the names of the customers who live in the same city as the
---   boss employee (the one who reports to nobody)

-- 5. how many audio tracks were bought by German customers, and
--    what was the total price paid for them?

-- 6. list the names and countries of the customers supported by
--    an employee who was hired younger than 35.
