# AngularDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3 using `ng new --minimal --routing angular-demo` to generate a minimal application with routing. Compoments were generated using `ng generate component [your-component-name] --flat=true --inlineStyle=true --inlineTemplate=true --skipTests=true` to simplify structure and minimize the number of files created.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
